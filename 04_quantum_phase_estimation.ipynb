The first register contains $t$ qubits which will represent (in binary) the phase $\\theta$, up to accuracy $2^{-t}$, and the second register will store the actual state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n","\n","Before we move on, let's introduce some quick notation. $|+\\rangle= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle)$, and $|-\\rangle= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|0\\rangle-|1\\rangle)$. That's it.\n","\n","The main trick to be identified here is as follow. Let's assume we have one qubit in the first register, and that we start in the state $|+\\rangle |\\psi\\rangle$. Applying a controlled $U^{k}$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$ with the first qubit as control, we get\n","\n","$\\begin{array}{ll}U^k (|+\\rangle |\\psi\\rangle)&= |0\\rangle|\\psi\\rangle + |1\\rangle U^k |\\psi\\rangle \\\\\n","&= |0\\rangle|\\psi\\rangle + |1\\rangle U^{k-1} U |\\psi\\rangle \\\\\n","&= |0\\rangle|\\psi\\rangle + |1\\rangle U^{k-1} e^{2\\pi i \\theta}  |\\psi\\rangle \\\\\n","&= |0\\rangle|\\psi\\rangle + |1\\rangle e^{2\\pi k i \\theta}  |\\psi\\rangle\n"," \\end{array}$\n","\n","Thus, if we apply $U$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$ with $q_0$ as control, then $U^2$ with $q_1$, $U^4$ with $q_2$, and so on, we can write out the state of the $t$ qubits of the first register: $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^{t/2}}}\\sum_{k=0}^{2^t-1}e^{2\\pi i \\theta k}|k\\rangle$.\n","\n","Now comes the most important part: you clearly see that the qubits have the form of a Quantum Fourier transformed register that we introduced last week (and it is clear that the values in the register represent a periodic function). So when we've applied all these phases to our qubits, all we need to do is apply an iQFT to get the bitstring $|\\theta_0...\\theta_{t-1}\\rangle$, which represents the binary expansion notation of the frequency $\\theta$, as we described in last week's notebook.  \n","\n","Alright, time to write this down.

Then, take $e^{iH}$ (it should be obvious why this is unitary). I already wrote a function for that, within a for-loop because we will need all the $U^{2^j}$ powers of the $U$ matrix right away.\n","\n","A little Python commentary here: in the `random_unitary_iter` I use the `yield` keyword. This creates an _iterable_ from the function. In a sense, it's kind of equivalent to creating a list and adding items to it, except, in the `yield` case, I don't know in advance what the list is like, its length, etc. The main advantage is that I don't need to compute everything first, and I can defer the computations to the for-loop.

The advantage of using the last method is that your circuit remember your different registers, and you don't need to remember them yourself.
